This is a elisp library for websocket clients to talk to websocket
servers. This library is designed to be used by other library writers,
to write apps that use websockets, and is not useful by itself.

An example of how to use the library is in the
[[https://github.com/ahyatt/emacs-websocket/blob/master/websocket-functional-test.el][websocket-functional-test.el]] file.

Currently, this library only supports unencrypted websockets.
